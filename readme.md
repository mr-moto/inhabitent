## Learning Experience
This is the biggest and most challenging project I have worked on so far. It took some time to get used to wordpress and how to implement php but the more I used it the easier it got. The sheer amount of styling and coding in a short amount of time was quite overwhelming, but this challenge motivated me to try hard and succeed. My skills using the various coding languages have improved vastly with this project.
