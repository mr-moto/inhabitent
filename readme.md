## Project
A multi-page wordpress powered website for a camping supply company. The objective for this project is to build a CMS site using WordPress.

## Technology
* Visual Studio
* HTML5
* Gulp
* CSS3/Sass/SCSS
* PHP
* WordPress
* jQuery
* Git/Github

## Learning Experience
This is the biggest and most challenging project I have worked on so far. It took some time to get used to wordpress and how to implement php but the more I used it the easier it got. The sheer amount of styling and coding in a short amount of time was quite overwhelming, but this challenge motivated me to try hard and succeed. My skills using the various coding languages have improved vastly with this project.

##TODO
* more variables, sass nesting etc
* Make it look prettier
* Implement custom screenshot
* Create mobile and tablet sites (make responsive)
* Finish styling adventure pages
